# Debugging Tint #

Tint can use all of the same debugging techniques as node, for more information on the built in debugger see: https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html

## Using node-inspector or node-debug ##

Tint includes a convenience command line tool called ```tntdbg`` which opens node-inspector or node-debug from Tint.  Ensure you have node 0.12.0+ and have globally installed node-inspector using npm. See https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector for more information on how to use the debugging tools and IDE.
